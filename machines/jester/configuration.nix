  # the *kernel* global OOM killer fired (89 oom-kill invocations in the
  # journal, 80 in a single day) and culled the graphical session wholesale
  # (pipewire, dbus-broker, the xdg portals), which is what made hyprlock
  # "sometimes crash" - it dies as collateral when the stack it renders on is
  # wiped. systemd.oomd (enabled in base.nix) acts on cgroup PSI but the
  # kernel global OOM, with no swap to provide reclaim runway, fired first.
  #
  # Three privilege-correct levers (verified: a user process here CANNOT set a
  # negative oom_score_adj, so "protect the session" via negative OOMScoreAdjust
  # on user units is not an option; instead we add swap headroom and bias the
  # killer toward builds, which are the actual trigger):

  #    transient spike compresses idle anonymous pages instead of hard-OOMing.
  #    Raised 25 -> 50 (2026-06): at 25% the device sat 100% full (7.6G/7.8G,
  #    SwapFree ~0) while measured compression was 4.85:1, so a 15.5G device
  #    costs ~3.2G RAM at this workload for +7.7G reclaim headroom. The
