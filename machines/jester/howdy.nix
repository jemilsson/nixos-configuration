# USB IR-camera face unlock via Howdy (fallback for the built-in IR camera,
# which is firmware-gated off on this unit; see DECISIONS.md).
#
# NOT imported by default. Two things gate turning it on:
#
# CONFLICT (must resolve first): Howdy's NixOS module asserts that
# `v4l2loopback` is NOT in `boot.kernelModules`. jester currently loads it there
# via room-watch.nix and presence-lock.nix, so importing this file as-is fails
# the build with:
#   "Adding 'v4l2loopback' to boot.kernelModules causes Howdy to no longer work."
# Resolve by removing "v4l2loopback" from `boot.kernelModules` in room-watch.nix
# (keep it in `boot.extraModulePackages`) and load it on demand instead, e.g. a
# oneshot `systemd.services.room-watch` ExecStartPre `modprobe v4l2loopback`,
# or gate room-watch and howdy so they are not both active. Verified: with the
# loopback in kernelModules the toplevel build aborts on that assertion.
#
# When you have a USB Windows-Hello IR camera:
#   1. Plug it in, find its IR video node:
#        v4l2-ctl --list-devices          # identify the camera
#        for d in /dev/video*; do echo "$d:"; v4l2-ctl -d $d --all 2>/dev/null \
#          | grep -iE "Pixel Format|Name"; done
#      The IR sensor is the node reporting a GREY/Y8 (mono) format, not YUYV/MJPG.
#   2. Set device_path below to that node.
#   3. Add `./howdy.nix` to imports in configuration.nix, rebuild.
#   4. Enroll your face:  sudo howdy add
#   5. Test:  sudo -k; sudo true   (should unlock by face, fall back to password)
#
# Security note (from the module itself): Howdy can be fooled by a printed photo.
# It is configured "sufficient" (an ADDITIONAL factor); password always still works.
# Do not make it the sole auth method.
